# Python-Challenge
The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

*Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

*The total number of months included in the dataset

*The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

*The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

*The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

*Your analysis should align with the following results:
